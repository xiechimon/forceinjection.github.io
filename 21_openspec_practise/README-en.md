# OpenSpec Practise

🌐 English Version | 🇨🇳 [中文版](./README.md)

This project originated from in-depth discussions on AI programming within the "AI Force Injection" community. In response to the community's vision of "leveraging OpenSpec for Spec-Driven Development," this project demonstrates the practical application of the OpenSpec specification in AI-assisted programming through a complete hands-on example.

As a learning and practice repository for OpenSpec, this project provides systematic documentation analysis, detailed user manuals, and multi-language examples, aimed at helping developers deeply understand and efficiently apply the specification.

## Core Features

This project is based on **OpenSpec v1.11.0** and demonstrates the following core features:

- **Explore First**: `/opsx:explore` acts as a thinking partner — investigate the codebase, weigh options, and clarify requirements before writing any specs or code. Zero-cost, low-risk exploration.
- **Spec-Driven Development**: Define specifications first, then write code, ensuring AI and humans reach a shared understanding of requirements.
- **Fluid Workflow**: Propose → Apply → Archive phases are no longer locked. You can go back and revise specs at any time, and explore can be interleaved at any stage.
- **Focused Review (Show --diff)**: `openspec show <change> --diff` lets delta review look only at lines that actually changed — although a MODIFIED requirement must restate every scenario it keeps, the diff renders just the real changes.
- **Dual-Language Implementation**: Using the same specification to drive both Node.js (zero dependencies) and Python (FastAPI + Pydantic) implementations.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests.
- **Stores (Beta)**: Cross-repository planning support. Centralize planning in a standalone store repo, with multiple code repos referencing read-only context via `references`.

## DDD to OpenSpec Mapping

The strategic insights of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) combined with the structured specifications of OpenSpec build a highly reliable connection system from domain models to engineering code. The standard mapping paths for converting DDD deliverables into the OpenSpec workflow described below are distilled from the open-source skill repository project [domain-driven-design-skills](https://github.com/ForceInjection/domain-driven-design-skills) (see the `ddd-openspec-mapping.md` document for details).

### 1. Strategic Alignment and Directory Mapping

At the strategic level, by introducing DDD's spatial partitioning methodology into OpenSpec's directory structure, a natural correspondence between design and specification can be achieved.

The "Bounded Context" in DDD corresponds to the sub-domain directories under the `specs/` directory in OpenSpec. This alignment ensures that every business boundary identified by DDD has a clear attribution in the engineering specifications. Meanwhile, declaring this mapping relationship in `openspec/config.yaml` provides the AI Agent with a global architectural context.

```yaml
# openspec/config.yaml example: Domain and Bounded Context mapping configuration
context: |
  ## Project Domain Mapping
  This system follows DDD design, and core bounded contexts include:
  - User Management Context
  - Order Management Context
  - Payment Context
```

### 2. Tactical Implementation and Structure Mapping

Tactical design determines the quality of code implementation. OpenSpec provides a structured expression method to transform DDD building blocks into verifiable and executable task sequences.

The table below shows the specific mapping relationship between OpenSpec core components and DDD deliverables:

| OpenSpec Specification Structure | Corresponding DDD Deliverable    | Description and Explanation                                                                  |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain**                       | **Bounded Context**              | A domain directory corresponds to a bounded context.                                         |
| **Requirement**                  | **Domain Service** / **Command** | Describes a core business function or operation.                                             |
| **Scenario**                     | **Aggregate Behavior**           | Uses Given/When/Then format to precisely describe aggregate behavior.                        |
| **Design**                       | **Application Service**          | Coordinates multiple domain services, manages transactions and security.                     |
| **Tasks**                        | **Tactical Design Backlog**      | Tasks for concrete implementations like entities, value objects, repository interfaces, etc. |

### 3. Workflow-Driven Lifecycle

OpenSpec v1.5.0's workflow highly aligns with DDD's iterative modeling, with special emphasis on explore-first and brownfield-first refactoring capabilities.

- **Explore**: Use `/opsx:explore` to investigate the codebase, compare options, and clarify requirements at zero cost. DDD's strategic storming can unfold naturally during exploration.
- **Propose**: Use `/opsx:propose` to initialize changes, dynamically fetching templates and context via `openspec instructions` to consolidate domain modeling conclusions.
- **Apply**: Utilize AI to implement code and perform automated verification based on the specifications. Specifications can be revised at any time — phases are not locked.
- **Sync**: Merge incremental spec changes into the master specification directory before archiving.
- **Archive**: Move the change to `changes/archive/` via `openspec archive`, ensuring a single source of truth for domain knowledge.
